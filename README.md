-------------------

# Installation Prerequisites
Please review the minimum requirements below to determine whether you will be able to
install and use the software.

- This integration requires Home Assistant Version 2023.1 or greater
- A Weather.com API Key is required (see below for how to get this)
[Back to top](#top) 

# Weather.com API Key
1) Open https://www.wunderground.com (Wunderground is owned by Weather.com and uses some of the Weather.com APIs)
2) View the page source in your browser.
3) In the source, search for "apiKey" and copy/paste that into the integration

Important notes:
* Wunderground PWS API Keys will not work for this integration, as they do not have access to the Weather.com APIs that this integration uses.
* It is unclear how long these API keys from the wunderground.com HTML source are valid for - you may need to change the API key regularly.

# Installation

Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS and install from there. Then:

1. In Home Assistant Settings, select DEVICES & SERVICES, then ADD INTEGRATION.  
2. Select the "Weather.com" integration.  
3. Enter your Weather.com API key and submit.  
4. After the integration setup is complete, you can select "Configure" to change:  

* Create Forecast Sensors, language, and override latitude and longitude for forecast.  
* Observation and condition sensors will be created and enabled.  
* Forecast sensors are not created by default. They will be created if you enable "Create Forecast Sensors" in the integration "Configure".  
* Forecast sensors will then be created but are disabled. To enable, goto the integration - entities and select the sensors you would like and enable them.

All the conditions listed above will be updated every 5 minutes.  

**_Weather.com API caveat:   
The daypart object as well as the temperatureMax field OUTSIDE of the daypart object will appear as null in the API after 3:00pm Local Apparent Time.  
The affected sensors will return as "Today Expired" with a value of "â€”" when this condition is met._**


Variations above marked with "#d" are daily forecasts.
Variations above marked with "#n" are nightly forecasts.


Note: While the platform is called weatherdotcom the sensors will show up in Home Assistant as  
```sensor.<location_name>_forecast_temperature_<suffix>```  
(eg: sensor.sanfrancisco_forecast_temperature_0d).

Additional details about the API are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14OK6NG5GRwezb6-5C1vQJoRdStrGnXUiXBDCmQP9T9s/edit).

# Weather Entity
Weather.com data returned to weather entity (HASS weather forecast card):  
Current:
- temperature
- pressure
- humidity
- wind_speed
- wind_bearing

Forecast:
- datetime
- temperature (max)
- temperature (low)
- condition (icon)
- precipitation
- precipitation_probability
- wind_bearing
- wind_speed

templates can be created to access these values such as:
```
{% for state in states.weather -%}
  {%- if loop.first %}The {% elif loop.last %} and the {% else %}, the {% endif -%}
  {{ state.name | lower }} is {{state.state_with_unit}}
{%- endfor %}.

Wind is {{ states.weather.<STATIONID>.attributes.forecast[0].wind_bearing }} at {{ states.weather.<STATIONID>.attributes.forecast[0].wind_speed }} {{ states.weather.<STATIONID>.attributes.wind_speed_unit }}

```

# Localization

Sensor "friendly names" are set via translation files.  
Weather.com translation files are located in the 'weatherdotcom/weather_translations' directory.
Files were translated, using 'en.json' as the base, via https://translate.i18next.com.  
Translations only use the base language code and not the variant (i.e. zh-CN/zh-HK/zh-TW uses zh).  
The default is en-US (translations/en.json) if the lang: option is not set in the weather.com config.  
If lang: is set (i.e.  lang: de-DE), then the translations/de.json file is loaded, and the Weather.com API is queried with de-DE.    
The translation file applies to all sensor friendly names.   
Forecast-narrative, forecast-dayOfWeek, forecast-daypart-narrative and forecast-daypart-daypartName are translated by the api. 
Available lang: options are:  
```
'am-ET', 'ar-AE', 'az-AZ', 'bg-BG', 'bn-BD', 'bn-IN', 'bs-BA', 'ca-ES', 'cs-CZ', 'da-DK', 'de-DE', 'el-GR', 'en-GB',
'en-IN', 'en-US', 'es-AR', 'es-ES', 'es-LA', 'es-MX', 'es-UN', 'es-US', 'et-EE', 'fa-IR', 'fi-FI', 'fr-CA', 'fr-FR',
'gu-IN', 'he-IL', 'hi-IN', 'hr-HR', 'hu-HU', 'in-ID', 'is-IS', 'it-IT', 'iw-IL', 'ja-JP', 'jv-ID', 'ka-GE', 'kk-KZ',

'tk-TM', 'tl-PH', 'tr-TR', 'uk-UA', 'ur-PK', 'uz-UZ', 'vi-VN', 'zh-CN', 'zh-HK', 'zh-TW'
```
Weather Entity (hass weather card) translations are handled by Home Assistant and configured under the user -> language setting.
